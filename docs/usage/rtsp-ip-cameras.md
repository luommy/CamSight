## 📋 Finding Your Camera's RTSP URL

### Method 1: Check Camera Documentation

Most IP cameras document their RTSP URL format in the manual or manufacturer's website.

**Common manufacturers:**
- **Reolink:** Usually port 554, path `/h264Preview_01_main`
- **Hikvision:** Usually `/Streaming/Channels/101`
- **Dahua:** Usually `/cam/realmonitor?channel=1&subtype=0`
- **Amcrest:** Similar to Dahua
- **Wyze:** Requires RTSP firmware, then `/live`
- **Generic ONVIF:** Try `/onvif1`, `/onvif2`, or `/stream1`

### Method 2: Use ONVIF Device Manager

1. Download [ONVIF Device Manager](https://sourceforge.net/projects/onvifdm/)
2. Scan your network for cameras
3. View camera's RTSP URL in the "Live Video" section

### Method 3: Check Camera Web Interface

1. Log into your camera's web interface (usually `http://camera-ip`)
2. Look for "Streaming", "RTSP", or "Network" settings
3. RTSP URL is often displayed there

### Method 4: Trial and Error

Try common patterns:
```bash
# Try default port and common paths
rtsp://camera-ip:554/stream
rtsp://camera-ip:554/stream1
rtsp://camera-ip:554/live
rtsp://camera-ip:554/h264
rtsp://camera-ip:8554/stream
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Frame Processing Interval

For continuous monitoring, adjust the **Frame Processing Interval**:

- **High frequency (5-30 frames):** More responsive, higher GPU usage
- **Standard (30-60 frames):** Balanced performance
- **Low frequency (120-300 frames):** Power-efficient, suitable for slow-changing scenes

Example: At 30fps camera, processing every 30 frames = 1 analysis per second.

### Recommended Settings by Use Case

**Real-time Safety Monitoring (Pool, Elder Care):**
- Frame Interval: **30** (1 sec at 30fps)
- Max Tokens: **100-150** (quick responses)
- Model: Fast model (e.g., `llama3.2-vision:11b`)

**Security Surveillance:**
- Frame Interval: **60-120** (2-4 seconds)
- Max Tokens: **150-256** (detailed descriptions)
- Model: Balanced model

**Periodic Monitoring (Pet cam, slow scenes):**
- Frame Interval: **300-600** (10-20 seconds)
- Max Tokens: **100**
- Model: Any model

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Supported Protocols

- **RTSP over TCP** (default, more reliable)
- **RTSP over UDP** (lower latency, less reliable)
- **H.264 video codec** (most common)
- **H.265 / HEVC** (if FFmpeg supports it)
- **MJPEG** (less efficient but widely compatible)

### Network Requirements

- **Local network:** Recommended for reliability and privacy
- **Port forwarding:** Not recommended for security reasons
- **VPN:** Acceptable for remote access
- **Bandwidth:** Minimal - only metadata sent to VLM (not video stream)

### Latency

Typical latency breakdown:
- **RTSP connection:** 500ms - 2s (initial connection)
- **Frame decode:** 10-50ms (depends on codec and resolution)
- **VLM inference:** 1-5s (depends on model and hardware)
- **Total:** ~2-7 seconds from camera to VLM response

For time-critical applications, use lower frame intervals and faster models.

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

### ⚠️ Important Security Notes

1. **Never expose RTSP publicly without encryption**
   - RTSP is not encrypted by default
   - Credentials are sent in plaintext
   - Use local network only or VPN for remote access

2. **Change default camera passwords**
   - Default passwords are easily exploited
   - Use strong, unique passwords

3. **URL credential visibility**
   - RTSP URLs with passwords are visible in browser network tab
   - Credentials are sanitized in server logs (password replaced with ****)
   - Don't share screenshots containing RTSP URLs

4. **Data processing**
   - Video is processed locally (not sent to cloud)
   - VLM inference happens on your hardware
   - Only analyzed text results are displayed

5. **Legal compliance**
   - Ensure you comply with local surveillance laws
   - Inform people they are being monitored if required
   - Don't use for unauthorized surveillance

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Connection Failed

**Error: "Failed to connect to RTSP stream"**

**Solutions:**
1. **Verify RTSP URL:**
   - Check IP address, port, and path
   - Try accessing via VLC: `Media > Open Network Stream > Enter RTSP URL`

2. **Check network connectivity:**
   ```bash
   ping camera-ip
   telnet camera-ip 554  # RTSP port
   ```

3. **Verify credentials:**
   - Ensure username and password are correct
   - Special characters in password may need URL encoding
     - Example: `@` becomes `%40`, `#` becomes `%23`

4. **Firewall/NAT:**
   - Ensure port 554 (RTSP) is not blocked
   - If running in Docker, use `--network host`

5. **Camera limits:**
   - Some cameras limit concurrent RTSP connections (typically 2-5)
   - Close other viewers (VLC, Blue Iris, etc.)

### Stream Drops / Disconnects

**Error: "RTSP stream ended unexpectedly"**

**Solutions:**
1. **Network stability:**
   - Use wired Ethernet instead of WiFi for camera
   - Check for network congestion

2. **Camera settings:**
   - Lower resolution/bitrate in camera settings
   - Enable "Consistent Bitrate" (CBR) instead of "Variable Bitrate" (VBR)

3. **Auto-reconnection:**
   - RTSP track automatically attempts reconnection
   - Check server logs for reconnection attempts

### No Video Display in UI

**Note: This is expected behavior in current version.**

- RTSP mode processes video on backend only
- Video element in UI won't show the stream
- VLM analysis results are still displayed
- **Future enhancement:** Server-sent frame display

### High CPU Usage

**Backend is decoding video frames continuously**

**Solutions:**
1. **Use lower resolution stream:**
   - Use camera's "sub-stream" instead of "main stream"
   - Example: Hikvision `/Streaming/Channels/102` vs `/101`

2. **Increase frame interval:**
   - Process every 120-300 frames for less frequent analysis
   - Still monitors continuously but reduces load

3. **Hardware acceleration (coming soon):**
   - NVDEC on Jetson for GPU-accelerated decoding
